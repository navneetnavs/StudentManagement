This project is a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) backend built with Spring Boot and Maven, designed for beginners to understand the core concepts of building RESTful APIs. It manages student data using a simple layered structure with controller, service, repository, and model, and uses Spring Data JPA with an H2 in-memory database for easy setup and testing. The application allows users to add, view, and delete students through HTTP endpoints, making it a simple and practical starting point for learning backend development with Spring Boot.
